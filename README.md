# README

Welcome to the Rails Chores App!  This app is designed to help anyone who would rather not live in squalor but wants to remain friendly with their house mates.  Administrators can reate chores with their own task lists and assign them to family or room mates.  Anyone can read the chore list and status updates can only be made to chores by their 'owners'.  Make new chore lists and keep the house looking great!

This repo is available on github:

    git@github.com:spensation/rails-chores-v-000.git

Fork and clone the repo.

import some basic chores to start with by running:

    rake db:seed

When signing up as a new user, give your house a name and register it to the app.  Members of your house can navigate to the house home page as a launch point for the app.
